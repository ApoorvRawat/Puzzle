# Puzzle Game Layouts by Apoorv

## What's in This Repo?
The repo contains parts done by Apoorv in the Android Puzzle Game project. Apoorv worked on creating the visual parts of our app using XML layout files in Android Studio.

## Apoorv's Contributions

### Layout Files Created:
- **activity_main.xml**: The main screen where you start the game or read the instructions.
- **activity_instructions.xml**: Shows how to play the game.
- **activity_game.xml**: The actual game screen with the puzzle.

### What Each File Does:
- **activity_main.xml**
  - Has buttons to start the game, see instructions, or exit the game.
  
- **activity_instructions.xml**
  - Displays game rules and a button to go back to the main menu.
  
- **activity_game.xml**
  - Sets up the playing area for the puzzle.


## Summary
Apoorv focused on making sure that the parts of our app you see and interact with are well-designed and make sense for users. This repo contains all his work on those designs.

Thanks for checking out our project!
